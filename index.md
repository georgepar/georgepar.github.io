Hi, I'm Giorgos.
I am a PhD student in the [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en)
under the supervision of Professor [Alexandros Potamianos](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en/staff/188).
I am a member of the [SLP group](https://slp-ntua.github.io/) and an Associate Researcher at the
[Institute for Language and Speech Processing](https://www.ilsp.gr/en/home-2/).

I have industry experience as an Applied Machine Learning intern with the Alexa group in [Amazon Lab126](https://amazon.jobs/en/teams/lab126/),
a Machine Learning Engineer in [Behavioral Signals](https://behavioralsignals.com/)
and a Software Developer at [Intracom Telecom](http://www.intracom-telecom.com/).

I'm interested in the fields of Multimodal Machine Learning, with emphasis on Multimodal
representations from audio, text and visual cues.
Other research interests include adaptation of NLP models for new domains and Affective Computing.
